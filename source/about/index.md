# Greetings! 

I am a graphic designer born and raised in Athens, Greece. I always was attracted to the visuals, and always wanted to work with pictures, shapes and colors. 

After graduating high-school, I scored my way into the only public digital arts university of Greece, the Audio and Visual Arts department of the Ionian University in Corfu, Greece. There, I studied the arts and familiarized with a variety of software, learned art history and created numerous projects. 

Since September 2015, I have been working for a clothes manufacturer and distributor brand in Greece, succesfully creating the visuals and art they need for their newsletter campaings, online banner commercials and social media content, as well as a large amount of retouching needed for their e-shop content. Meanwhile, I have been working on various projects including business card design, landing page design and web commercials.
