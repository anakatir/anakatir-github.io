# Greetings! 

I am a graphic designer born and raised in Athens, Greece. I always was attracted to the visuals, and always wanted to work with pictures, shapes, and colors. 

After graduating high school, I scored my way into the only public digital arts university of Greece, the Audio and Visual Arts department of the Ionian University in Corfu, Greece. There, I studied the arts and familiarized with a variety of software, learned art history and created numerous projects. 

Since September 2015, I have been working in the fashion industry, successfully creating visuals and art for my clients' newsletter campaigns, online banner commercials and social media content, as well as retouching, offline material, and web design. Meanwhile, I am trying to stay up to date with the current trends and to develop my skills. Over the last months, I have been taking courses on a slightly different field, that of User Experience design.
